# Release 1.0.0

This is the first 'stable' release, coinciding with the GEX thesis submission.

GEX 1.0.0 is stable under normal operation and has been tested in several demo projects.

Please report any bugs to the author.

## Known issues

- SPI TxOnly mode doesn't work correctly, do not use it
- Frequency capture sometimes bugs out and crashes (especially at high frequencies)
- ADC performance is not what it could be
- DAC may get a little choppy if many other units are used at the same time
